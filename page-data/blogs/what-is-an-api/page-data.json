It acts as a bridge between different systems, allowing them to share data and functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An API consists of a set of functions and procedures that can be accessed by other software systems, typically over a network. These functions and procedures are designed to perform specific tasks, such as retrieving data from a database or sending data to a remote server. The API defines the input and output of these functions, as well as any errors that may occur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>APIs are used in many different contexts, but they are commonly found in web and mobile development. For example, when you use a mobile app to order food from a restaurant, the app likely uses an API to communicate with the restaurant&#8217;s ordering system. Similarly, when you use a website to check the weather, the website likely uses an API to communicate with a weather forecasting service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several different types of APIs, each with its own set of characteristics and purposes. Some common types of APIs include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Web APIs: These are APIs that are accessed over the internet using the HTTP protocol. They are typically used to provide web-based services, such as online shopping or social media.</li><li>Remote APIs: These are APIs that allow different systems to communicate over a network, such as a local area network (LAN) or the internet. They are often used to allow different systems to share data and functionality.</li><li>Library APIs: These are APIs that are built into software libraries, such as the standard libraries provided with programming languages like Java or Python. They are typically used to provide common functionality that can be used by other software systems.</li><li>Operating system APIs: These are APIs that are built into operating systems, such as Windows or Linux. They are typically used to allow different programs to access the resources and functionality provided by the operating system.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, APIs are an essential part of modern software development, allowing different systems to communicate and share data and functionality.</p>\n","slug":"what-is-an-api","tags":{"nodes":[{"name":"Education"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://wp.kalmars.lv/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/243042993_2403971433070528_3824359321844165877_n.jpg","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/b535c031598016d4f36bcbf229cbbdbd/243042993_2403971433070528_3824359321844165877_n.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b535c031598016d4f36bcbf229cbbdbd/b74b1/243042993_2403971433070528_3824359321844165877_n.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b535c031598016d4f36bcbf229cbbdbd/d3fc0/243042993_2403971433070528_3824359321844165877_n.jpg
